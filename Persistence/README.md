# Project Title

JavaScript Practice Kata - Persistence

Persistence is a function that takes a number, multiplies the individual digits until it is of length 1 and returns the number of times it had to run.

EG: 355 => 3 x 5 x 5 = 75

    75 => 7 x 5 = 35

    35 => 3 x 5 = 15

    15 => 1 x 5 = 5

    returns count = 4
